# Commander
Commander is a web UI that provides touch control of an ATEM Extreme and 5 x PTZ cameras.

It was built to support easy control of our switcher and cameras used during Sunday services streamed to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPb62fbC7uBtisUjU__I47g).

The primary design goal was swift control over 5 PTZ cameras, plus provision of a touch-equivalent to a traditional hardware switcher featuring dedicated preview and programme bus selectors. Also included is a 'peek' feature, allowing an operator to have a 2nd preview option without tying up the preview bus.
